A collection of numerical and algorithmic subroutines I've implemented and found helpful for various tasks:

- `ssk.jl` – String Subsequence Kernel (SSK) implementation
- `rsvd.jl` – Randomized Singular Value Decomposition
- `gp.jl` – Gaussian Process Regression
- `fft.jl` – Examples showcasing usage of FFTW.jl
- `bfs.jl` – Breadth-First Search for finding connected components from an adjacency matrix
- `BO_1d.jl` – 1D Bayesian Optimization example
- `lsh.jl` – Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) implementation
